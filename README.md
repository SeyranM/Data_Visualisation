# Data_Visualisation

## About the Project
Data_Visualisation is an educational project focused on learning the fundamentals of data visualization using Python 3. In the project it is used a variety of datasets, culminating in a final project that involves creating visualizations for a football dataset named f_data_sm.rda.

## Datasets
The project covers a wide range of datasets, providing a comprehensive learning experience in data visualization techniques. For the final project, f_data_sm.rda, a rich football dataset, is used to demonstrate advanced visualization concepts and applications in sports analytics.

## Technical Requirements
This project requires Python 3. Ensure Python 3 is installed and running on your system. Familiarity with Python's data handling libraries such as Pandas and visualization libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn or Plotly is recommended.

## Installation
No specific installation process is required for the project materials. However, make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed to run and interact with the Python scripts.

## Usage
To engage with the project:

 - Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
 - Open Jupyter Notebook in the directory where the project files are located.
 - Navigate through the folders and open the .ipynb files to view the scripts.
 - Run the scripts in Jupyter Notebook to see the data visualizations.

## Output
Each folder within the project contains scripts for visualizing different datasets. The output is a set of comprehensive visualizations that provide insights into the data, tailored for each dataset. The final project's output is a detailed visualization of the football dataset, demonstrating the application of various visualization techniques in sports data analysis.
